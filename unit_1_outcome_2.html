            <p>The tools is used to create my website were Trello and Visual Studio Code (VS code), I’m happy 
                <br>with these tools since using Trello made it very easy to take the whole project and break it down 
                <br>into smaller more manageable tasks, that i can track the progress of, and mark what I’ve finished, 
                <br>and what I still need to work on.
            <br>Using VS Code made it easy to take everything I’ve written and transfer it on to VS Code and 
            <br>code it into my website, and add CSS to make it look better organised. VS Code allows me to 
            <br>work on both the HTML part of my site and the CSS at the same time, and using the live studio 
            <br>extension I could easily see what I was doing in real time, as a function website, before I published it live.

                    <h4 class="headers">2.2 -</h4>
                        <p>VS Code and Trello were appropriate for the task of creating a website, since they both give users 
                            <br>the ability to do what's needed and edit them if needed, on Trello i was able to break down the 
                            <br>project into smaller tasks and colour coordinate them for each webpage (blue for home, red for 
                            <br>2nd page etc.)
                        <br>VS Code allows users to write in 3 coding language (JavaScript, CSS, HTML), all which are used 
                        <br>to build a website, as well as see them live in a live server page, that functions as a live version 
                        <br>of the work being worked on, in this case a website, and see the changes being made in real 
                        <br>time. This made it easy for me to see if there were places I needed to fix due to errors.

    <div>
            <h4 class="headers">2.3 - </h4>
            <p>I’m currently happy with my website, but I also know I could put more into it, to make it more 
            <br>unique, to this I need to become more familiar with CSS and Flex Box, and play around with 
            <br>them, to edit the layout and look of my website. I want to change the layout to make it look more 
            <br>professional, or maybe make it dark mode style (dark background, light text), maybe add some of 
            <br>my instagram photos or even a small game for visitors to enjoy. Maybe when I’m more familiar 
            <br>with how to code HTML and CSS I could add a fun easter egg to my site, just as a little 
            <br>something to make it unique.

    <div>
            <h4 class="headers">2.4 - </h4>
            <p>I could improve my project by doing more research on the topics that I’m working on, 
                <br>and use notes better. I could use trello more efficiently as currently I have it set with 
                <br>each task laid out in a way that makes them easy to follow, but not laid out neatly. I 
                <br>could better lay my tasks out so that they are clear to see, and in an order that’s easier to follow.
