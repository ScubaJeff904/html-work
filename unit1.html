    <h4 class="headers">1.0 - About me:</h4>
<p>I am a passionate PC gamer who has spent 1000s of hours playing video games on my 
<br>PC, I spent 2 years in college studying Video Game Development, and decided to come 
<br>to code nation to learn the skills that the college course missed, which was coding. 
<br>The experience I have had has given me the skills I needed to look at code and understand 
<br>what I’m looking at without it looking like a crazy bunch of something that did something 
<br>but I didn’t know what.

<h4 class="headers">1.1 - The purpose of IT in modern business:</h4>
Companies can use IT to make business a lot easier than it was a decade ago, they can 
<br>do this by using any of these methods:<ul>
<li>Communication: Companies can us IT to Email, VoIP (Voice of Internet Protocol), live 
    <br>chat, online meeting tools, and video conference systems to easily share files and talk to 
    <br>each other with ease, even if they aren’t in the same building or even the same country. 
    <br>Using these they can also communicate with customers.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Inventory: Inventory and stock management can be done with the use of IT, companies 
        <br>can easily see how much stock they have left, and easily communicate with providers to 
        <br>order more if needed, they can also see what is selling quickly and make arrangements 
        <br>to create a sale of bulk items.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Data Management: Thanks to modern IT development companies can store 100,000s of 
            <br>documents without filling a room with dozens of filing cabinets, they can then with a 
            <br>simple click of a button access any document they need, or search for any archived data. </li>
            <br>
        <li>Management Information Systems (MIS): MIS enables companies to manage all the data 
            <br>stored and monitor sales data, expenses, and productivity. The data stored can be used 
            <br>to maximise investment returns, profits and areas that require improvement. Companies 
            <br>can use the data to see sales to track lower than expected numbers in the sale of items, 
            <br>and make amends by either boosting staff productivity or reducing the price of items.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Customer Relationship Management (CRM): CRM is beneficial to businesses since it 
                <br>makes helping customers much simpler, now if a customer calls with an issue with a 
                <br>product, the customer support service can easily bring up all the data about the order 
                <br>including the item, shipping information, and can bring up any documents that came with 
                <br>the item such as an instruction manual, and assist the customer efficiently, or if needed 
                <br>help with returning the order and issuing a refund or replacement.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
            <h4 class="headers">1.2 - Product Management:</h4>
            <p>In order to make a product successfully a product manager needs to use a number of 
                <br>skills and methods to be able to gain the most productivity and create a product with little 
                <br>to no issues. Some of the things a product manager will need to think about are:<ul>
            <li>Creating a plan of the project and sharing it with the other people they’re working with.</li>
            <br><li>Set a budget on how much they are wanting to spend on the project</li>
            <br><li>Set a deadline of when they want the project completed.</li>
            <br><li>Assigning tasks to the correct people who specialise in that area to maximise productivity.</li>
            <br><li>Scheduling check-ins to allow everyone know what's been done, what needs doing and keep up on progress of the project</li>
            <br><li>Escalating challenges when they’re needed, so if something needs doing quickly they need to bring people together and get them done.</li></ul>
    </p></div>
    <div>
            <br><p>On top of thinking about all of this a product manager also needs skills that can help 
                <br>maximise productivity and help push a project out quickly and efficiently, these skills are:<ul>
                    <li>Collaboration - They need to be able to work with others to successfully complete a project</li>
                    <br><li>Communication - They need to be able to communicate with people clearly, since if they fail to communicate 
                        <br>then no one will know what to do or who’s doing what.</li>
                    <br><li>Problem solving - They should be able to solve problems</li>
                    <br><li>Organization - They need to be organized since a cluttered work space will lead no many issues and loss of information</li>
                    <br><li>Multi-task - Multi tasking is a must, they need to be able to do more than 1 thing at a time, 
                        <br>since they could be asked to do something else quickly while working on something else 
                        <br>that is important</li></ul>
    </p></div>
    <div>
            <br><p>Something that product managers will need to always use is the Management Tools, this 
                <br>is so they can easily monitor progress, and amend any issues that arise such as a key 
                <br>project member being away, the manager can use the tools to check to see if they can 
                <br>afford the time to wait until the member is back to finish the task, then change the 
                <br>deadline dates and make everyone aware of the change, or if they can’t afford the time 
                <br>they can reassign the task to another person that has either completed the task they’re 
                <br/>on, or have no current project to work on.

            <h4 class="headers">1.3 - Planning my website using IT:</h4>

            <p>To start planning my website I will break the project down into smaller tasks, and complete
                 <br>them 1 at a time, rather than all at the same time, causing myself many issues and
                  <br>possibly having to restart parts of it because I’ve messed them up. To do this I will be
                   <br>using a Trello board, which allows me to make lists of what I need to do, what I’m 
                   <br>working on, and what I’ve completed. This also allows me to focus on important parts 
                   <br>first. I’ll also be using Google Docs to make notes that I can refer back to if needed.
            <br>

            <h4 class="headers">1.4 - What could cause Projects to Fail:</h4>

            <p>There are many things that could cause projects to fail, it’s up to the Project Manager to 
                <br>try and minimise or eliminate these if possible. But sometimes these issues are 
                <br>completely unavoidable and can cause major problems that could either halt progress or 
                <br>completely shut a project down. The issues could be any of the following:<ul>
            <li>Human Error - an employee could accidentally delete something or miss click somewhere and, 
                <br>cause issues which need to be solved ASAP, they could prevent this by saving the files regularly.</li>
            <br><li>System Glitches - even though computers are getting more advanced by the day, they 
                <br>aren’t completely safe from problems, at any point a glitch could occur that could cause a 
                <br>computer to crash, causing major issues, and worse than this it could cause data 
                <br>corruption, which would cause a catastrophic problem if the data doesn’t have previous 
                <br>save points that the user can load up and re-do the parts that haven’t saved.</li>
            <br><li>Poor Management - if a Manager doesn’t do what they are supposed to do, then the 
                <br>employees won’t be able to work with full productivity and miss deadlines, or not 
                <br>complete essential tasks.</li></ul>

            <h4 class="headers">1.5 - How to select the correct tools for the Job:</h4>
            <p>There are many ways a business can select the correct tools and software for the job, to 
                <br>start they can research the best or latest online, and look for reviews on that particular 
                <br>tool or software. As for the correct technology they can easily browse 1000s of choices 
                <br>online, and decide what best suits their needs.

        <div>
            <h4 class="headers">1.6 - How has my chosen technology helped me:</h4>
             <p>Technology has helped me in a big way throughout the course, with the use of Trello I’m 
            <br>able to break down a project into smaller tasks, plot them on trello and see what I need to 
            <br>do, I’m working on and I've completed. With trello I am able to add labels to each task, so 
            <br>if I’m working on multiple projects with similar tasks, I can assign them a different colour 
            <br>and see if I’ve completed the correct task.
            <br>Using Git and GitHub I’m able to upload my projects to a Repository and download them, 
            <br>anywhere I need to (i.e. in class, at home) to work on them, then upload an updated 
            <br>version. Also with GitHub it keeps a record (Different Versions) of everything I've done to 
            <br>a project in, so that if I’ve done something incorrectly, I can easily grab an older version 
            <br>and work from that, rather than having to delete a lot of work that I may still need.

            <h4 class="headers">1.7 - How does GDPR affect Projects</h4>
            <p>
                EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) effects Project Management and 
                <br>development in many ways. Due to the regulations in place, people have the right to 
                <br>request all data stored about them, they also have the right to object it being stored, or 
                    <br>have it all completely erased, unless it needs to be kept for certain reasons. These can 
                    <br>can cause projects to be delayed, since a small project team need to be certain they can 
                    <br>follow these regulations before starting a project. With GDPR data storage companies 
                    <br>but notify everyone on their system if a data breach occurs, and alert them to the 
                    <br>possibility that there stored data may now be accessible to hackers, it is up to the data 
                    <br>storage company to do everything they can to keep all data stored, as secure as possible.
