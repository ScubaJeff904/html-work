            <p>I could have been more efficient by better allocating my time to the bigger tasks, and 
                <br>work on them first, as they need the most attention, over smaller tasks that I could do 
                <br>within a few minutes. I could have also worked as part of a team and allocated tasks 
                <br>evenly between everyone in the team, so that work was spread evenly and everyone 
                <br>had something they could have been working on, then come together once all tasks 
                <br>were completed then put them together, thus completing the project quicker.

            <p>There are many ways that productivity could be improved, for one share work loads with a team, 
                <br>and allocate deadlines that need to be met, so that work on other tasks can be worked on, then 
                <br>projects can be completed quicker than if someone worked on them alone, and rushed to get 
                <br>everything done, and possibly missed something that could have been important.
            <br>Efficiency can be improved in the same way, sharing work within a team, means that multiple 
            <br>tasks can be worked on at the same time, which allows deadlines to be met.

        <h4 class="headers">3.4 - </h4>
        <p>I could test projects through a range of ways, the 1st way would be using the VS Code extension 
            <br>of a Live Server which allows me to see changes made to my code in real time, and fix any errors 
            <br>that I see. Another way is to share the code with a team Iâ€™m working with and have them run, and 
            <br>test to see if there's anything that I missed that needs correcting. Other ways include beta 
            <br>phases, in which I could upload my project as a live website/app and have a select group of 
            <br>people provide feedback via surveys or reviews, and make changes needed, then have the same 
            <br>group of people test if everything is working as intended. I could then after this release an early 
            <br>release, in which I allow the public to access my website/app and ask them how well it functions, 
            <br>then make changes and update when needed. Then when everything is working correctly and 
            <br>the public users are happy, I could push a live version.
